# Hedera Smart Contract Lazy Lotto

A comprehensive decentralized lottery and rewards system built on the Hedera network, featuring two distinct lottery mechanisms: a flexible multi-pool lottery system (LazyLotto) and a trade-based reward system (LazyTradeLotto).

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements sophisticated lottery and reward systems that leverage Hedera's native capabilities including HTS (Hedera Token Service), PRNG (Pseudo-Random Number Generation), and smart contract functionality. The system is designed to provide fair, verifiable, and engaging lottery experiences while maintaining security and scalability.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Contracts

#### 1. **LazyLotto** - Multi-Pool Lottery System
A comprehensive lottery platform supporting multiple independent lottery pools with various prize types, ticket systems, and bonus mechanisms.

**⚠️ Breaking Changes - December 2025:** Contract API updated to v2.1 with paginated query functions. See [API Breaking Changes Guide](./LazyLotto-API_BREAKING_CHANGES.md) for migration instructions.

**Key Features:**
- Multiple independent lottery pools with customizable parameters
- Support for HBAR, HTS tokens, and NFT prizes
- Dual ticket system: memory-based (gas efficient) and NFT-based (tradeable)
- Sophisticated boost system for enhanced win rates
- Prize management system with convertible prize NFTs
- Admin-controlled pool lifecycle management
- **Paginated queries** for scalability with 100+ prizes/pools
- **Documentation**: See [Business Logic](./LazyLotto-BUSINESS_LOGIC.md), [UX Guide](./LazyLotto-UX_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md), and [API Changes](./LazyLotto-API_BREAKING_CHANGES.md)
- **Scripts**: 22 interaction scripts in `scripts/interactions/LazyLotto/`
- **Tests**: Comprehensive test suite in `test/LazyLotto.test.js`
- **Contract Size**: 23.782 KB / 24 KB (optimized)

#### 2. **LazyTradeLotto** - Trade-Based Reward System
A reward mechanism that incentivizes NFT trading activity with lottery-style prizes and a progressive jackpot system.

**Key Features:**
- Trade-triggered lottery rolls for both buyers and sellers
- Progressive jackpot system with automatic growth
- LSH NFT holder benefits (zero burn rate)
- Cryptographic security with signature validation
- Anti-replay protection with trade fingerprinting
- Comprehensive analytics and event tracking
- **Documentation**: See [LazyTradeLotto Business Logic](./LazyTradeLotto-BUSINESS_LOGIC.md)
- **Scripts**: 12 interaction scripts in `scripts/interactions/LazyTradeLotto/`
- **Tests**: Complete test suite in `test/LazyTradeLotto.test.js`

#### 3. **HTSLazyLottoLibrary** - HTS Operations Library
A specialized library handling complex Hedera Token Service operations required by the lottery systems.

**Key Features:**
- NFT collection creation and management
- Batch NFT minting, transfers, and burning
- Token association and validation
- Royalty fee configuration
- Optimized batch operations with gas management

### Supporting Infrastructure

#### External Dependencies
- **LazyGasStation**: Manages automatic HBAR/$LAZY refills and token operations (1 query script)
- **LazyDelegateRegistry**: Handles NFT delegation for bonus calculations (2 scripts, test suite)
- **LazySecureTrade**: Peer-to-peer NFT trading platform that triggers LazyTradeLotto (3 admin scripts)
- **PrngSystemContract**: Provides verifiable random number generation

## 🔐 Admin Powers & Governance

### Transparency First

LazyLotto v3 uses a **centralized admin model** for operational efficiency while maintaining strong **user protections**. We believe in transparency - here's exactly what admins can and cannot do.

### What Admins CAN Do

**System Operations:**
- ✅ Pause/unpause the system for emergency maintenance
- ✅ Create global (team) pools with no creation fees
- ✅ Set creation fees for community pools (HBAR + LAZY)
- ✅ Configure bonus systems (time windows, NFT holdings, LAZY balance)
- ✅ Add/remove global prize managers (for sponsored prizes)
- ✅ Close malicious or abandoned pools (only if no outstanding entries)

**Financial Operations:**
- ✅ Set platform fee percentage (capped at maximum 25%)
- ✅ Withdraw platform fees (5% default from pool proceeds)
- ✅ Withdraw surplus tokens (beyond prize obligations)
- ✅ Emergency actions via pause (user prizes remain safe)

### What Admins CANNOT Do

**User Protections Built Into Smart Contracts:**
- ❌ **Cannot steal prizes** - Prize accounting enforced by contract math
- ❌ **Cannot change fees retroactively** - Each pool locks its fee % at creation
- ❌ **Cannot withdraw prize-obligated tokens** - Safety checks prevent this
- ❌ **Cannot modify existing pools** - Fee structures are immutable per pool
- ❌ **Cannot access user's NFT tickets** - Users maintain full custody
- ❌ **Cannot prevent prize claims** - Claimable even when paused

### Security Guarantees

1. **Prize Obligations Protected**: Contract enforces `storageBalance - withdrawal >= prizesOwed`
2. **Fee Lock-In**: Platform fee frozen at pool creation (no bait-and-switch)
3. **Platform Fee Cap**: Maximum 25% (prevents confiscatory fees)
4. **Rounding Favors Users**: Pool owners get dust from integer division
5. **Multi-Admin Support**: Multiple admins reduce single point of failure
6. **Reentrancy Protection**: Double guards on LazyLotto + PoolManager

### Current Admin Configuration

**Testnet**: Multi-signature Gnosis Safe recommended  
**Mainnet**: Multi-signature wallet required (2-of-3 or 3-of-5)

### Potential Governance Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Current)**: Centralized admin for rapid iteration and support  
**Phase 2 (6-12 months)**: Community oversight via $LAZY as a governance token  
**Phase 3 (Future)**: Full DAO governance for major decisions

**Why Centralized Now?**
- Quick response to bugs or exploits
- Flexibility for feature additions
- Community support and moderation
- Platform sustainability (5% fee for development)

**Community Protection:**
- Transparent documentation (this section!)
- On-chain verification of all admin actions
- Regular security audits
- Open-source contracts for review

### Questions About Admin Powers?

See our comprehensive security analysis: [LazyLotto-SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md](./LazyLotto-SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md)

**TL;DR**: Admins have operational control but **cannot harm users financially**. Your prizes and pool terms are protected by immutable smart contract logic.
