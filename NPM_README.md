# @lazysuperheroes/lazy-lotto

LazyLotto and LazyTradeLotto lottery systems on Hedera - ABIs and CLI tools.

## Overview

This package provides:

1. **ABIs** for integrating LazyLotto and LazyTradeLotto into your dApp
2. **CLI tools** for interacting with LazyLotto directly from the command line

### LazyLotto

A multi-pool lottery system where users can:
- Buy entries into different prize pools
- Roll entries to try winning prizes
- Win HBAR, HTS tokens, and NFTs

### LazyTradeLotto

A trade-based reward system triggered by NFT marketplace trades. Rolls require backend counter-signing, so only ABIs are exposed (no CLI commands).

## Installation

```bash
npm install @lazysuperheroes/lazy-lotto
```

## For dApp Developers

### Importing ABIs

```javascript
const {
  LazyLottoABI,
  LazyLottoStorageABI,
  LazyTradeLottoABI,
  LazyGasStationABI,
  LazyDelegateRegistryABI
} = require('@lazysuperheroes/lazy-lotto');

// Or use the abi object for dynamic access
const { abi } = require('@lazysuperheroes/lazy-lotto');
console.log(abi.LazyLotto); // Same as LazyLottoABI
```

### Using with ethers.js

```javascript
const { ethers } = require('ethers');
const { LazyLottoABI } = require('@lazysuperheroes/lazy-lotto');

// Create contract instance
const lazyLotto = new ethers.Contract(
  '0.0.YOUR_CONTRACT_ID',  // Hedera contract address
  LazyLottoABI,
  provider
);

// Read pool info
const poolInfo = await lazyLotto.getPoolBasicInfo(0);
console.log('Win rate:', poolInfo.winRate);

// Buy entries (requires signer)
const tx = await lazyLotto.buyEntry(0, 5, { value: entryFee * 5 });
await tx.wait();
```

## Documentation

Additional documentation included in the package:

- **LazyLotto-BUSINESS_LOGIC.md** - Game mechanics and rules
- **LazyTradeLotto-BUSINESS_LOGIC.md** - Trade lottery mechanics
- **LazyLotto-UX_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - User experience flows
- **LazyTradeLotto-UX_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Trade lottery UX
- **docs/MULTISIG_*.md** - Multi-signature admin operations

## Key Concepts

### Entry Flow

1. **Buy entries** - Pay entry fee (HBAR or token) to get entries
2. **Roll entries** - Play your entries against the win rate
3. **Claim prizes** - Collect any prizes you've won

### Win Rate

Win rates are expressed in "thousandths of basis points" (0.0001% precision):
- `10000` = 1% win rate
- `100000` = 10% win rate
- `500000` = 50% win rate

### Boosts

Users can earn win rate boosts from:
- Holding $LAZY tokens
- Owning LSH NFTs
- Delegated NFTs

### Token Allowances

When paying with tokens (not HBAR):
- Approve tokens to **LazyLottoStorage** contract (not LazyLotto)
- For $LAZY payments, approve to **LazyGasStation** contract

## Error Handling

Common errors and solutions:

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `PoolPaused` | Pool is temporarily paused | Wait or try another pool |
| `PoolClosed` | Pool no longer accepts entries | Try another pool |
| `InsufficientBalance` | Not enough tokens | Add funds |
| `InsufficientAllowance` | Token not approved | Approve to storage contract |
| `NoEntries` | No entries to roll | Buy entries first |
| `NoPrizes` | No prizes to claim | Win some prizes first |
